# this script is designed to install the ISC Kea DHCP4 server to a Debian Linux system. It should also work on a Ubuntu system.
# run this as root (for testing purposes). 
# Otherwise, your account will need to be a sudoer and you will need to add `sudo` before `bash` on line 12, and at the beggining of lines 10, 11, and 13. 
# make sure you chmod +x this script before running.
# this script installs kea-1-8, for newer versions, modify line 12
