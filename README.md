Config files for Building Linux Servers (DHCP, DNS, DS) Webinar.

Make sure you are logged in as root to a Debian system.

Access the  ~ directory:

cd ~

Download this repository there. 

git clone https://github.com/daveprowse/bls-ddd.git

That will create the bls-ddd directory. 

Access it with: 

cd bls-ddd

Copy the individual files to their respective locations as we proceed. 

Enjoy!

Notes: 
1. For the webinar I am using Debian 10.4 as a server for DHCP and DNS (with no desktop environment).
2. The configuration files are based on one of my test labs that runs on the 172.21.0.0/16 network.
3. For FreeIPA I am using Fedora Server but you can use CentOS 8 as well.
